# Dahms_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI2270

This is a simple project that manipulates a group of numbers by putting them into and reading them out of various data structures.
The list of numbers' length and content will be decided by the user and can be changed or cleared.
The data structures used will be:
1. Linked Lists
2. Binary Search Trees
The numbers can be taken out of the BST with:
1. Pre-order traversal
2. In-order traversal
3. Post-order traversal
Other methods will include:
1. HasPathSum
2. Shortest Path Algorithms
