# Dahms_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI2270

This is a simple project that manipulates a group of numbers by putting them into and reading them out of various data structures.
The list of numbers' length and content is decided by the user.
The data structures are:
1. Vectors
2. Binary Search Trees
The numbers can be sorted with:
1. Quick Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Bubble Sort
The numbers can be printed from the BST with:
1. Pre-order traversal
2. In-order traversal
3. Post-order traversal

How to run

Run by downloading main.cpp, Manipulator.cpp, and Manipulator.h.  When you first run the program it will tell you to enter some numbers.  Do this by typing any number, then hitting enter, then repeat until you have entered as many numbers as you want.  If you do not enter a number my program will read it as a zero and it will not be added to the numbers vector.  This also means that the program does not accept zeroes in the vector.  After you have finished entering you numbers the program will tell you the numbers in the numbers vector in the order you put them in.  You can then manipulate the numbers by using the main menu.

What to add

If you want to add something it would be nice if there was a function that could randomize the numbers in the vector so all 3 sorting algoritms could be tested in the same run.
